# Introduction:

Automated Information extraction is the process of extracting structured information from unstructured/semi structured documents. This project focuses on semi-structured documents. Semi-structured documents are documents such as invoices or purchase orders that do not follow a strict format the way structured forms to, and are not bound to specified data fields. 
Information Extraction holds a lot of potential in automation. To name a few applications:
- Automatically scan images of invoices (bills) to extract valuable information.
- Build an automated system to automatically store revelant information from an invoice: eg: company name, address, date, invoice number, total  

In order to be able to do this, here are the basic steps:
- Gather raw data (invoice images)
- Optical character recognition (OCR) engine such as [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io) or [Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr).
- Extract relevant/salient information in a digestable format such as json for storage/analytics.

The main issue/concern with this approach is that invoices do not follow a universal pattern.

# Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)

Graph Neural Networks is a subset of deep learning with a lot of stuff done in it.Check this out! [Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf)


Check out [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-convolutional-networks-for-geometric-deep-learning-1faf17dee008) excellent introduction to Graph Neural Networks.

OF the subset, here is another subset: 
## Spectral Convolutions
Blog post by the author:
https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/
<br>
_Convolution_ 
: In mathematics convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other.



Convolutions can be computed in by finding the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian

Why Conventional Convolutional Neural Network methods dont work:
- There is no Euclidean distance in graphs.
- Graphs have a certain number of nodes. 
- There is no notion of direction in graphs.

Overall steps are
- Transform the graph into the spectral domain using eigendecomposition
- Apply eigendecomposition to the specified kernel
- Multiply the spectral graph and spectral kernel (like vanilla convolutions)
- Return results in the original spatial domain (analogous to inverse GFT)

A kernel is a matrix, which is slid across the image and multiplied with the input such that the output is enhanced in a certain desirable manner.

# Give example of a graph and adjacent, degree and laplacian matrix

### Laplacian matrix ( & Eigen vectors &)
The Laplacian is used in calculating “graph gradients,” i.e. measures of how much the function values is changing at each node, relative to the function value at nearby nodes, according to the weight with each of those neighbor nodes. __ When you calculate the eigenvectors of the Laplacian, you end up with a Fourier basis for the graph,,This enables us to project the graph onto a N-dimensional Euclidean space and results in axes also known as '__spectrum__' of the graph,__ Hence the name __Spectral Convolution__

It’s possible to transform both your data and your filters such that each filter is represented by a simple diagonalized matrix (all zeroes, except for values along the diagonal), that gets multiplied against a transformed version of the data. This simplification happens when you perform a Fourier Transform of your data. Fourier transforms are typically thought of in the context of functions, and (on a very high level), they represent any function as a weighted composition of simpler “frequency” functions; starting with low frequencies that explain the broad strokes pattern of the data, and ending with high frequencies that fill in the smaller details.

Principle behind this:
- Calculate the Ajacent/weight matrix and Diagonal matrix for a graph
- Calculate the Laplacian matrix ( D- A) (give a sense of euclidean space)
- Calculate the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix (Spectral domain)
- You end up with a Fourier basis for the graph. 
 Fourier Transform [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY).
To build an intution of how it all ties to Fourier Transform, [this](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/fourier.pdf) is an excellent paper. 
__Key take-away__: When you calculate the eigenvectors of the Laplacian, you end up with a Fourier basis for the graph

- Project both weights and data into that basis (results in a convolution)

To calculate spectral convolutions through this method, you first need to calculate the full NxN Laplacian eigenvector matrix of the graph, and then multiply each filter, as well as the data itself, by that matrix. This is quite computationally intensive for large graphs, since it scales by N² for each filter.

To summarize it in code form:

# Main Paper: 
SEMI-SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf

In Kipf and Welling’s Graph Convolutional Network, a convolution is defined by: 

![g_{\theta {}'} \star x \approx \sum_{k=0}^{K} \theta {}'_{k}T_{k}(\tilde{L})x](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g_%7B%5Ctheta%20%7B%7D'%7D%20%5Cstar%20x%20%5Capprox%20%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7BK%7D%20%5Ctheta%20%7B%7D'_%7Bk%7DT_%7Bk%7D(%5Ctilde%7BL%7D)x)


Where gθ is a kernel (θ represents the parameters) which is applied (represented by the star) to x, a graph signal. K stands for the number of nodes away from the target node to consider (the Kth order neighborhood, with k being the the closest order neighbor). T denotes the Chebyshev polynomials as applied to L̃ which represents the equation:

![\tilde{L} = \frac{2}{\lambda _{max}}L - I_{N}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctilde%7BL%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Clambda%20_%7Bmax%7D%7DL%20-%20I_%7BN%7D)


Where λ max denotes the largest eigenvalue of L, the normalized graph laplacian. Multiple convolutions can be performed on a graph, and the output is aggregated into Z.

__This is the main point :__ 

![Z = \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\tilde{A}\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}X\Theta ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z%20%3D%20%5Ctilde%7BD%7D%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D%5Ctilde%7BD%7D%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7DX%5CTheta%20)

Where Z is a matrix of convolved signals (from neighboring nodes) Ã is the adjacency matrix of the graph (plus the identity matrix), D̃ is the diagonal node degree from Ã, Θ is a matrix of kernel/filter parameters (can be shared over the whole graph), and X is a matrix of node feature vectors. The D to the power of -1/2 are parts of a renormalization trick to avoid both exploding or vanishing gradients.



In a general/broad sense, the Fourier transform is a systematic way to decompose “generic” functions into a superposition of “symmetric” functions.



"The Fourier transform is also related to topics in linear algebra, such as the representation of a vector as linear combinations of an orthonormal basis, or as linear combinations of eigenvectors of a matrix (or a linear operator)." - _Tao_

better explanation of that can be found [here](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/2009/lect02-09.pdf
)



A graph can be represented as a matrix. For example:
-> 
<br> as you can see, then you can have an adjacent matrix.
Then you can have a diagonal matrix.

From that you can calculate the Laplacian matrix .

\[L = D - A\]

Chebyshev polynomial
------------------------

The kernel equals the sum of all Chebyshev polynomial kernels applied to the diagonal matrix of scaled Laplacian eigenvalues for each order of k up to K-1.

First order simply means that the metric used to determine the similarity between 2 nodes is based on the node’s immediate neighborhood. Second order (and beyond) means the metric used to determine similarity considers a node’s immediate neighborhood, but also the similarities between the neighborhood structures (with each increasing order, the depth of which nodes are considered increases).

__Consider avoiding Chebyshev to avoid overfitting.__

__ChebNets and GCNs are very similar, but their largest difference is in their choices for value K in eqn. 1. In a GCN, the layer wise convolution is limited to K = 1__


Steps:
----------------------
From the paper: 
- Eigen decomposition of Laplacian (fourier Transform) gives the filter 
- use 4 GCN layers ( first layer learns 16 different filters/graph patterns(neurons))
- second learns 32
- third learns 64
- fourth is the output layer

The aggregation over the neighborhood of a node in the network is analogue to a pooling operation in a convolutional neural network and the multiplication with the weight matrix W is analogue to a filtering operation. Although these operations are similar — hence the similarity in names between GCNs and CNNs — they are not the same.
